# Clocks!!!!

##### cue Coldplay

Today you are going to build a clock as a pure front-end app!

### Step 1 - Get time

Use the correct JavaScript function to get the current time and display in digital form showing hours, minutes and seconds e.g. `09:15:27`.

### Step 2 - Update time

Try using `setInterval` function to keep getting the time every second (so that you can show time updating every second)

## Extension:

### Step 3 - Go analogue!

It's time to make your clock analogue! Create the necessary DOM elements for the shape of the clock and the hour, minute and second hands.

### Step 4 - Complete moving clock

- Get the hour, minute and second hands to move as time changes e.g. (each second that passes, the second hand should move).
- To get the hands to rotate around the clock, you should look into the css property: `transform: rotate()`.
