# Make Them Green

1. Create 3 boxes (divs) in an html file, give them a border of `1px solid black` and a height and width of `100px`, so you can see them.
2. When you click on any box, it's background color should immediately become **red**.
3. After **every** box has been clicked, change all of them immediately to **green**.
