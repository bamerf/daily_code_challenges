# Intersection Warmup

**Credit to Axel for this warmup.**

**Please complete this warmup in JavaScript without the use of any libraries.**

You are given three arrays, write a function `threeWayIntersection` which only returns the common elements in all three arrays.
For example:

```javascript
threeWayIntersection([1, 3, 4, 6], [2, 3, 4, 7], [3, 4, 7, 8, 9]); // => [3,4]
```

### Extension

Now write a function which returns the common elements for `n` arrays. For example:

```javascript
nWayIntersection([[3, 9], [6, 8, 9], [1, 9, 10], [9], [9, 11, 14]]); // => [9]
```
