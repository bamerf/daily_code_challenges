# Winnie the Pooh's Honey Problem

You have 100 jars of honey in a row that are all initially **closed**. You make 100 visits to the jars of honey.

The first time around, you visit every jar and toggle the lid (if the jar is closed, you open it; if it is open, you close it).

The second time you only visit every 2nd jar of honey (jar #2, #4, #6, ...). The third time, every 3rd jar of honey (jar #3, #6, #9, ...), etc, until you only visit the 100th jar of honey.

**Question:** Write a function that shows which jars of honey are **open** after Pooh's last pass?
