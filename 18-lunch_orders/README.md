## Lunch Orders

It's approaching lunch hour… let's collect orders. Create a new file called `lunch_orders.rb` to complete this exercise.

1. Create a program that collects lunch orders. Prompt:
   - **Name for order:** (enter name)
   - **{name} wants to order:** (enter item)
2. Store the name/order data. When storing data, do it in such a way that additional order items may be added for the person's name.
   - Example: **Greg** can order a _Burger_, and then add _Fries_ to his order later.
3. After storing data, prompt the user with:
   - **Add another item to the order? (y/n)**
   - Repeat steps 1 & 2 if the answer is "y"
4. After the user completes adding orders, print out:
   - **"All orders: {order data}"**

### Keep going...

Rather than printing out a blob of raw lunch order data, print each name's orders on a separate line, formatted as one of the following:

- "Greg ordered a sandwich"
- "Peter ordered a burger & fries"
- "Travis ordered a salad, apple & water"
